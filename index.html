      <h2><span class="text-primary">The History</span> Of Our Hotel</h2>
      <p>It was a great summer evening in December 12th 1967 when Miss Jane Halliwell decided she would host
        a group of friends in her inherited family building and when they decided to pay her for it, a new
        form of hospitality was born.
